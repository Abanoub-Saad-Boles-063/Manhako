𝑀𝐶⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ = 𝑟റ x 𝐹റ= ( -3 , -6 ) x (-2 , -3 ) = −3 𝑘⃑റ 
∴ 𝑀𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ = 𝑀𝐶⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ               ∴ the line of action of  𝐹റ // 𝐵𝐶⃡⃑⃑⃑⃑    
𝑀𝐷⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ = 𝑟റ x 𝐹റ= ( -1 , 0 ) x (-2 , -3 ) = 3 𝑘⃑റ

2000 -20 x = 30 x  
50 x = 2000  
   ∴ x = 40 cm    
the magnitude of the resultant is 50 newtons in the direction of the two forces at 40 cm  
  from B . 
EXAMPLE (2) : 
 𝐹1 ,𝐹2 are two parallel forces in opposite directions act at the two points A, B respectively,  
   𝐹1 > 𝐹2 , if the magnitude of the resultant of the two forces = 90 kg.wt and acts at the  
  point C ∈ 𝐴𝐵⃡⃑⃑⃑⃑  where AB = 36 cm , AC = 16cm  ,find 𝐹1 ,𝐹2  
Solution 
R = 𝐹1 − 𝐹2             
 ∴  𝐹1 − 𝐹2 = 90                  (1) 
    𝐹1 × 16 = 𝐹2 × 52         (2) 
     By solving the two equations   (1)  , (2)         
∴ 𝐹1 = 130 𝑘𝑔.𝑤𝑡     ,𝐹2 = 40 𝑘𝑔.𝑤𝑡 
EXAMPLE (3): 
   Two parallel forces of magnitudes 12, F newton and their resultant is 3 newtons and its 
line of action is 30 cm distant from the line of action of the first force, show that F has two 
values and find the distance between the lines of action of t he two forces in the two cases.  
Solution 
The resultant is less than one of the two forces: 
 ∴ the two forces are in opposite directions and 
FIRST :       12 > F 
    R = 12- F  
     3 = 12- F                             F= 9 newton

If a body is in equilibrium under the action of set of coplanar parallel forces then 
: 
 The sum of algebraic measures of the forces = zero 
 The sum of algebraic measures of the moments of the forces about any 
point in its plane 
   equals zero  
Expressions guide to the equilibrium:   
About to move – about to rotate – without upsetting the equilibrium – 
 the least weight can be hanged - the maximum weight can be hanged                                                                            
Example (1) : 
 𝐴𝐵̅̅̅̅ is a uniform rod of length  60 cm and  weight 40 gm .wt rests on a support 
at 20 cm  distant from A ,the rod is kept in equilibrium horizontally by a light 
vertical string connects at its end B ,find the magnitude of the tension in the 
string and the reaction of the support ? 
Solution  
r + T = 40   
                                              
the sum of moments of the forces about C  = zero 
40 x 10 -T x 40 = zero                    
 ∴ T = 10 gm.wt

Example (2) : 
𝐴𝐵̅̅̅̅ is a uniform rod of length 40 cm and weight 6 kg .wt rests horizontally on 
two supports at C  and D , the distance between the two supports is 20 cm, it is 
found that the rod is about to rotate if a weight 9 kg.wt is suspended from A. 
find the distance between the two supports. 
Solution 
 
 
 
 
 
when a weight 9 kg.wt hanged from A, then the rod about to rotate 
       ∴ 𝑟2 = 0  
the sum of moments of forces about C = 0 
    6 X  - 9 (20 - X ) = 0  
    6X -180 + 9X = 0                   ∴  X = 12 cm    
∴ the distance between the support C and the point A = 8 cm  
 the distance between the support  D and the point B = 12 cm 
Example (3) : 
𝐴𝐵̅̅̅̅ is a uniform rod its length 60 cm and weight 3.6 kg .wt. rests horizontally on 
two supports one of them is 5 cm distant from A and the other is 10 cm distant

Definition: 
Couple: a system of two forces of equal magnitudes  
and in opposite directions and acting in different lines of action. 
Theorem: 
 The moment of a couple is a constant vector does not dependent on the point 
about which we take the moments of the two forces 
𝑀⃑⃑റ = 𝐵𝐴⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ × 𝐹റ = 𝐴𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ × −𝐹റ 
 Norm of the moment of the couple = 
 magnitude of one of the two forces x the perpendicular distance between the line 
of action of two forces 
 
 
 
 The sign of the algebraic moment of the couple is negative  
      if the rotation is clockwise. 
  The sign of the algebraic moment of the couple is positive 
        if the rotation is anticlockwise. 
Definition: 
 If the two couples are in equilibrium, then the sum of their moments = zero 
           i.e.  M1 + M2 = 0 
 If the two couples are equivalent, then M1 = M2

Solution 
∵ The two forces form a couple          ∴ 𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟏 = −𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟐 
∴ a = -2   b = 5 
Example 2: 
If the magnitude of the moment of a couple is 350 newton.m and the 
magnitude of one of the two forces is 70 newton, then: find the length 
of   
the arm of the moment. 
Solution 
M = F x r                    ∴ 350 = 70𝑟                     ∴ 𝑟 = 5 𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑒

   a couple. Find a + b + c 
Solution 
 𝑏 = -5 ,   𝑎 = 9 ,    𝑐 = - 3    ∴ 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 = 1 
Example 4: 
If 𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟏,𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟐 are two forces form a couple where 𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟏 = −𝟑𝒊റ+ 𝟐𝒋റ acts at 
the point A (1, 1), 𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟐 acts at the point B (-1, -2) find the moment of 
the couple and the length of perpendicular drawing from A on the 
line of action of 𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟐 
Solution 
𝑴⃑⃑⃑റ = 𝑨𝑩⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ × 𝑭⃑⃑റ𝟐 =(-2,-3) x (3 ,-2) = ( 4+ 9) 𝒌⃑⃑റ = 13 𝒌⃑⃑റ 
M = F x r   ∴ 13 = √13 𝑟  ∴ √13  length unit

First case:  
If a set of forces form many couples, 
 then the set is equivalent a resultant couple. 
Its moment = the sum of algebraic measure of the moment of these couples 
Example (1) 
ABCD is a square of side length 30 cm, forces of magnitude 6, 4, 6, 4 
newton act at 𝐴𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ,𝐶𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ,𝐶𝐷,⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ 𝐴𝐷⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ respectively and two forces each of 
magnitude 2√2 newton act at the two points A , B in the direction of 
𝐵𝐷⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ,𝐷𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ respectively . Find the algebraic measure of the moment of 
the couple which equivalent to the system. 
 The two forces (4, 4) form a couple  
       ∴M1=4 x 30 = 129 newton.cm  
 The two forces (6, 6) form a couple  
       ∴M2= - 6 x 30 = -180 newton.cm  
 The two forces (2√2, 2√2) form a couple  
       ∴M2= - 2√2x 30√2 = -120 newton.cm  
∴ the system is equivalent to a couple the algebraic measure of  its 
moment = 120 – 180 – 120 = -180 newton.cm 
Remember that: 
 The two diagonals of the square are perpendicular, equal in length and 
     bisect each other  
 The length of the diagonal = √2 L      where L is the side length

Example (2) 
ABCD is a parallelogram in which AB = 6cm, BC= 8cm, m(∡A)= 60o. forces 
of magnitude 6, 9, 6, 9 gm. wt act  at 𝐴𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ,𝐶𝐵⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ,𝐶𝐷,⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ 𝐴𝐷⃑⃑⃑⃑⃑റ respectively prove 
that the system equivalent to a couple and find its moment. 
Solution 
 Two diagonals are not equal , not perpendicular and bisect each other. 
 Each two opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.  
BE= 6 sin 60O = 3 √3 cm 
BO = 8 sin 60O=3 √3 cm 
 The two forces (6, 6) form a couple  
       ∴M1= - 6 x 4 √3 = -24 √3 hg.wt.cm  
 The two forces (9, 9) form a couple  
       ∴M2= 9 x 3 √3 = 27 √3 hg.wt.cm  
 
 ∴ the system is equivalent to a couple,

Second case: 
A system of coplanar forces is said to be equivalent to a couple if the following 
two conditions are satisfied together: 
1. The sum of the algebraic components of the forces in any direction = zero. 
2. The sum of the moment of the forces about any point ≠ 0  
Third case: 
If the sum of the algebraic measure of the moment of a system of coplanar forces 
with respect to three non collinear point in its plane is constant and is not equal 
to zero, this system equivalent to a couple the algebraic measure of its moment 
equals this constant.
