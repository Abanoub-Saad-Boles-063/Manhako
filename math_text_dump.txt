We studied before Repeated Multiplication: 
 x × x × x  ×………….  × x = xn,    where   x ∈ R and  n ∈ Z+  
 xzero = 1.                                         where x ∈ R – {0} 
 𝐱 - n = 𝟏
𝐱𝐧                                            where x ∈ R – {0}, 
Laws of the Exponents 
(1) xn × xm = xn + m 
(2) xn÷ xm = xn - m  
(3) (xn)m = xnm 
(4) (x y)n = xn × yn  
(5) (x ÷ y)n = xn ÷ yn

If n is an even number, then x is a real non-negative number.

Rules of solving exponential equations: 
 If xn = xm ,  then n = m. 
 If xn = yn ,  then  x = y              if n is an odd number. 
                      Or  x = ± y          if n is an even number. 
                      Or  n = 𝒛𝒆𝒓𝒐      if x ≠ y. 
Example 1: 
                          If   3x – 5 = 9,  find the value of x  
Solution: 
                   3x – 5 = 32 
 
                 ∴ x – 5 = 2                        
                 ∴ x = 7                                 
         
 
Example 2: 
                          If   3x + 7 = 1,  find the value of x  
Solution: 
                   3x + 7 = 3zero 
 
                 ∴ x + 7 = zero                        
                 ∴ x = -7

                          If  4 x – 1   = 5 x – 1  , find the value of x  
Solution: 
                   x – 1 = zero 
 
                 ∴ x = 1                        
 
Example 4: 
                          If   52x – 1  = 𝟏 
𝟏𝟐𝟓 ,  find the value of x  
Solution: 
                   52x – 1  = 5-3 
 
                 ∴ 2x – 1 = - 3                       
                 ∴ 2x = - 2                           ∴ x = - 1                                   
                         
Example 5: 
                          If ( 𝟑
𝟓 )x  =( 𝟐𝟕

Solution: 
                   ( 𝟑
𝟓 )x  =( 𝟑
𝟓)-3 
                  
                 ∴ x = - 3               
Example 6: 
                   Solve the equation: √𝟗𝟑
 = 27x +2 
Solution: 
   
9 = 273 (x +2) 
         32 = 39 (x +2) 
                 ∴ 9(x+2) = 2 
                 ∴ x = 𝟐
𝟗 – 2                                         ∴ x= - 𝟏𝟔
𝟗

Example 7: 
 
Find the value of x which satisfies the equation: 
                      3 x+1 + 3 x – 1 = 90. 
Solution: 
                      3x (3 + 3-1) = 90 
                      3x × 𝟏𝟎
𝟑  = 90            (By dividing both of sides by 𝟏𝟎
𝟑  ) 
                      3x = 27             
                      3x = 33              
                   ∴ x = 3

Example 1: 
Find the Solution Set of the following equation: 
           49x – 50× 7x + 49 = 0 
Solution: 
           7 2x – 50× 7x + 49 = 0 
           ( 7x – 1 )( 7x – 49) = 0           
                         7x – 1 = 0                                   7x – 49 = 0 
                         7x  = 1                                        7x = 72 
                        ∴ x = 0                                     ∴ x = 2 
                               S.S. = { 0, 2} 
Example 2: 
If f(x) = 5x, then find the value of x if     f(x) + f(3 – x) = 30 
Solution: 
                             5x + 53 – x = 30                  (multiply by 5x) 
                             5 2x + 53 = 30 × 5x 
                             5 2x – 30 × 5x + 125 = 0 
                            ( 5x – 25 )( 5x – 5) = 0           
                         5x = 25 = 52 5x = 5 
                        ∴ x = 2                                        ∴ x = 1

The logarithmic function: 
If a ∈ R+– {1}   where:  y = loga x       (logarithmic form) 
 can be converted to the exponential form   x = ay 
Notice that: 
 There is no logarithm for a negative number. 
 There is no logarithm for Zero. 
Example 1: 
Find the value of x if: log𝑥 81 = 4  
Solution: 
         logx 81 = 4       (convert to the exponential form) 
        ∴ x4 = 81 
        ∴ x = (81)
1
4                                         
        ∴ x = 3         ( and the negative value is refused) 
 
Example 2: 
Find the value of x if: log5 125 = x 
Solution: 
         log5 125 = x       (convert to the exponential form) 
        ∴ 5x = 125
        ∴ 5x = 53                             
        ∴ x= 3

Example 1: 
Solve the equation: 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝟑 𝐱 = 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐱 𝟑 
Solution: 
 
                 𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝐱 
𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝟑 = 𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝟑 
𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝐱 
 
            (log x)2 = (log 3)2 
 
            Log x = ± log 3 
     log x = log 3                                  Or           log x = - log 3                                   
    ∴ x = 3                                                            log x = log (3)- 1  
                                                                                  ∴  x = 𝟏

               ∴ S.S.= {3, 𝟏

Example 2: 
Solve the equation:  log (x2 + 9x) = 1 
Solution: 
Convert from logarithmic form to exponential form  
( note: the base is 10) 
 
                      x2 + 9x = 10 
                      x2 + 9x – 10 = 0 
        (x + 10)(x – 1) =  0      
        ∴ x = - 10         or      x = 1 
    ∴ S.S. ={ -10, 1}

Example 1: 
Find the value of x if: 35x – 2 = 7x +1 
Solution: 
 
(by taking logarithm for both sides) 
            (5x – 2 ) log 3 = (x + 1) log 7 
            5x log 3 – 2log 3 = x log 7 + log 7 
            5x log 3 – x log 7 = 2log 3 + log 7 
            x(5 log 3 –  log 7) = 2log 3 + log 7 
 
        ∴ x = 
𝟐 𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝟑+𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝟕

Example 2: 
If: 5x + 2 = 32x – 5, then Find the value of x to the nearest two decimals places  
Solution: 
 
            (x + 2 ) log 5 = (2x – 5) log 3 
            x log 5 + 2log 5 = 2x log 3 – 5log 3 
            x log 5 – 2x log 3 = -2log 5 – 5 log 3 
            x(log 5 – 2 log 3) = -2log 5 – 5 log 3 
 
        ∴ x =

Fundamental Counting Principle: 
If the number of ways to perform a certain task = m, 
 the number of ways to perform another certain task = l, 
the number of ways to perform a third certain task = n and so on …. 
then: the number of ways to perform these tasks together = m×l ×n ×…… 
Example 1: 
By how many ways it is possible to choose a boy from a group of three boys 
and a girl from a group of two girls?  
Solution: 
Number of ways = 3 × 2 = 6 ways. 
 
Example 2: 
By how many ways it is possible to choose a uniform which consists of a shirt 
and a trousers from 5 shirts and 3 trousers? 
Solution: 
Number of ways = 5 × 3 = 15 ways. 
Example 3: 
By how many ways it is possible to forma  3-digit number from the set  
    { 1, 2, 3, 4}?  
Solution: 
Number of ways = 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 ways. 
 
Example 4: 
By how many ways it is possible to form a 3-digit from the set { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}?

Example 5: (conditional counting principal) 
By how many ways it is possible to form different 3-digit number from the set  
                              {1, 2, 3, 4}?  
Solution: 
Number of ways = 4 × 3 × 2 = 24 ways. 
One of the digits takes units place and is not repeated in the other places  
One of the 3 remainder digits takes tens place and isn’t used again. 
The remaining 2 digits takes hundreds place. 
 
Example 6: (conditional counting principal) 
By how many ways it is possible to form a 3-digit different number from the 
set  
                              {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}?  
Solution: 
Number of ways = 3 × 4 × 4 = 48 ways. 
 
We cannot put the zero in the hundreds place.   
Number of ways to choose a digit in the hundreds place = 4 
Number of ways to choose a digit in the tens place = 4 
Number of ways to choose a digit in the units place = 3

Definition: 
We denote to number of combinations formed from (r) objects chosen from 
(n) elements by   nCr    where    r ≤ n,    r ∈ N,   n ∈ Z+ 
 
The rules of combinations: 
For all   r ≤ n,    r ∈ Z+,    n ∈ Z+ 
 
 nCr =    𝒏
𝒓        𝒏−𝒓          
  
 
 If  nC x = nC y , then: x = y or x + y = n 
 nCr = nCn-r                              (reducing law) 
 nCn = nCzero = 1

  Example 1:   
If  n C n – 2 = 36, then: find the value of n 
Solution: 
 
   n C n – 2 = n C 2 = 36 = 9 C 2 
 
∴ n = 9

  Example 2:   
If  21 C 4n – 7 = 21 C 3n   then find the value of n 
Solution: 
 
   4n – 7 = 3n                                         4n – 7 + 3n = 21 
 
∴ n = 7                                                   ∴ n = 4 
 
  Example 3:   
If      7 C r = 7 C 3r – 5 ,    n C r : n C r – 1 = 8 : 3 ,  find the value of n and r 
Solution: 
 
   3r – 5 = r                                        3r – 5 + r = 7 
 
∴ 2r= 5 ( refused)                             ∴ r = 3 
 
                         n C r : n C r – 1 = 8 : 3

  Example 4:  
By using the calculator, find the value of: 5C 4 + 7 C 2 
Solution: 
5 shift ÷ 4 + 7 shift ÷ 2 = 
 The result = 26
